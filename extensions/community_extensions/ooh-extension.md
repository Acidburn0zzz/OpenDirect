### OpenDirect-OOH Extension

#### Issue: [#4](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/OpenDirect/issues/4)

Sponsor: Outsmart and the UK OOH Industry Standards Committee

The goal is to better support OOH transactions.

OpenDirect-OOH is an extension of the OpenDirect schema, particularly around the ‘Product Target’ function, to accommodate the unique aspects of the ‘real world’ OOH inventory in the dimensions of location, delivery, distribution, investment and display prohibitions. OpenDirect (and OpenRTB) trades with real time Audience impressions, whereas Out-Of-Home media can be sold in the wider dimensions of predefined time, share of time, physical locations as well as audience impressions. OOH Media manifests itself as display of the advert on a frame at a defined location and time which then gives an audience in the vicinity of that advert an opportunity to see the advertising.

OpenDirect-OOH uses the concept of ‘OOHbjects’ which are used to discover and target the multidimensional aspect of OOH media. An OOH media owner/ publisher can use one or more OOHbjects to translate their sales policy into DealIDs or Products that can then be discovered, targeted and traded programmatically.

Creative Assignment has been omitted from the OpenDirect-OOH 1.5.1 document as this will be addressed in OpenDirect (OOH) 2.0 using the AdCom model as described in the IAB Tech Lab's OpenDirect 2.0 documentation for Video and OOH media support.
